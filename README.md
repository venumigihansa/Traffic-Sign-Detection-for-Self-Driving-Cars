## 📂 Dataset

This project uses the **German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB)** for training the YOLOv11s model.

🔗 [Download GTSDB Dataset (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AudgxEPmgsP-0HrYzBKzAV0Gn2tyAJjI/view?usp=drive_link)

The GTSDB dataset consists of **approximately 900 annotated images** in **PPM format** and includes **42 distinct traffic sign classes**, such as speed limits, warnings, and prohibitions. These images represent real-world dashcam scenarios, making the dataset suitable for training detection models for autonomous driving.

The trained model is capable of detecting up to **42 different traffic sign categories** in real-time dashcam footage with high accuracy.
